# Pantry Pal 2

This application will serve as the backend server for Pantry Pal 2 app. 
Pantry Pal is a food inventory and recipe management application. This is a rework of
my original Pantry Pal application which was a CLI application made in plain ruby. 

## User Experience

A user logs into the app and has access to a virtual pantry. The pantry models the foods and thier
amounts located in the user's actual home. 


Goals for this project:

1. Update original pantry pal concept and redesign as an api to power a ReactJS front-end

2. Utilize tersilst driven development
