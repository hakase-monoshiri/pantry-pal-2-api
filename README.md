# Pantry Pal 2

This application will serve as the backend server for Pantry Pal 2 app. 
Pantry Pal is a food inventory and recipe management application. This is a rework of
my original Pantry Pal application which was a CLI application made in plain ruby. 

## User Experience

A user logs into the app and has access to a virtual pantry. The pantry models the foods and thier
amounts located in the user's actual home. The user can look at the pantry pal app and see what foods
they own, and the amount of each ingerdient. 

The user will also be able to use a seperate view to search for recipes. They can also choose to view recipes 
that they are able to make based on the ingredients currently on hand. 


Goals for this project:

1. Update original pantry pal concept and redesign as an api to power a ReactJS front-end

2. Utilize tersilst driven development
